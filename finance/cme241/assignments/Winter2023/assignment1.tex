{\large {\bf Stanford CME 241 (Winter 2023) - Assignment 1}}
\end{center}
 
{\large{\bf This ``assignment'' is simply to complete the following tasks to get set up for course work and future assignments:}}
\begin{questions}
\question Make sure you have access to the course Canvas and Ed Discussion pages (email amil@stanford.edu if you do not)
\question Install/Setup on your laptop with LaTeX/Markdown (for technical writing), Python 3 (and optionally Jupyter, if you prefer working with .pynb instead of plain .py).
\question {\em Fork} the \href{https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/RL-book}{Code Repo associated with the RLForFinanceBook} and get set up to write code (for future assignments) that uses classes/functions from this code repo.
\question Create clearly-named separate directories for each assignment/course project for the Course Assistant (\href{mailto:amil@stanford.edu}{\underline{\textcolor{blue}{Amil Merchant}}}) to review and grade the assignments/course project - each team (who does the assignments/course project together) should send Amil their forked repo URL and {\em git push} their work by the assignment/course project due dates (to their forked repo).
\question {\bf Optionally}, you can create the same virtual environment I use and replicate my dependencies with the following instructions:
\begin{itemize}
\item After forking the repo on your laptop, create a virtual environment with the following shell command (from the RL-book directory):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ python3 -m venv .venv
\end{lstlisting}
\item Then, each time you're working on this project, make sure to activate the venv with the following shell command (again, from the RL-book directory):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ source .venv/bin/activate
\end{lstlisting}
\item Once the venv is activated, you should see a (.venv) in your shell prompt
\item Now you can use pip to install dependencies inside the venv, for example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
(.venv) $ pip install matplotlib
\end{lstlisting}
\item Initially, you can install every Python package you need to work this git repo with the following shell command (again, from the RL-book directory):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{lstlisting}
\item To work with the appropriate file paths of the Python files in this repo from the RL-book directory, execute the following command from the RL-book directory (this creates a pckage):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
(.venv) $ pip install -e .
\end{lstlisting}
\item To make sure you are all good, verify with the following command from the RL-book directory:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
(.venv) $ python -m unittest discover
\end{lstlisting}
If all is good, you should see an "OK" on the last line of the output upon running this command.
\end{itemize}
\end{questions}
