\begin{questions}
\question Derive the solution to Merton's Portfolio problem for the case of the $\log(\cdot)$ Utility function. Note that the derivation in the textbook is for CRRA Utility function with $\gamma \neq 1$ and the case of the $\log(\cdot)$ Utility function was left as an exercise to the reader.
\question One of the reasons the backward induction solution in \href{https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/RL-book/blob/master/rl/chapter7/asset_alloc_discrete.py}{rl\//chapter7\//asset\_alloc\_discrete.py} is slow is that we work with a generic \lstinline{Distribution} type for \lstinline{risky_return_distributions}, which means we have to sequentially sample from it to create the states distribution (in method \lstinline{get_states_distribution}) that can be passed as input to \lstinline{back_opt_qvf}. Modify the code to create a special type of distribution for the returns of the risky asset so we have a direct way of obtaining the probability distribution of the risky asset price at any time step (and hence, the probability distribution of wealth at any time step). With a direct way to obtain probability distribution of states at any time step, we can speed up the code considerably.
